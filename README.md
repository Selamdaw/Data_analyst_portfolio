# Gym Members Exercise Dataset Analysis

## Description
**Description:** This project analyzes gym members' exercise patterns, physical attributes, and fitness metrics through SQL-based queries and Excel visualizations to uncover demographic trends, workout intensity, and fitness progression. Using interactive charts, providing a comprehensive view of member behaviors, health trends, and correlations between metrics like heart rate, workout duration, and calories burned.

## Project Overview
**Overview:** This analysis aims to support gym management and trainers in designing tailored fitness programs and optimizing training recommendations based on membersâ€™ unique profiles, using data-driven insights from 973 samples of gym data to create visualizations offering insights into how demographic factors impact fitness behaviors and progress.

## Questions
**Research Questions:**  
- How do demographic factors (age, gender) relate to workout intensity and duration? 
- What are typical heart rate patterns, and how do they correlate with calories burned? 
- Can we identify trends in fitness progress over time based on experience levels?

## Data Sources
**Sources:** Data was sourced from Kaggle sample dataset saved as 'gym_members_exercise_tracking.csv' in the dataset folder.

## Technologies Used
**Technologies:** This project was developed using Excel for the creation of visualizations, Jupyter Notebooks for initial data processing, and SQL for data cleaning, managing and manipulating data.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
**Collection:** Data from the gym members exercise sessions were collected from a kaggle dataset by Kala Khorasami for data scientists, health researchers, and fitness enthusiasts interested in studying exercise habits or analyzing the relationship between demographic and physiological data to use. 

### Data Cleaning
The 'gym_members_exercise_tracking.csv' data underwent a rigorous cleaning processes, including unit conversions, alignment corrections, and formatting to ensure compatibility with visualization tools. <br>
<br>**Cleaning:** To clean and preprocess the data, it involved removing duplicates. After selecting all columns to check if duplicates could exist across any of them, the output message confirmed there were no duplicates found. <br> <br> Next, the data was processed for having any missing values. After applying Conditional Formatting, highlighting Cell Rules and adding a filter on Excel to highlight any blanks, it found that were no missing values found on this dataset. <br> <br> Using Conditional Formatting to highlight extreme values it revealed potential outliers in both Calories_Burned and Session_Duration (hours). In the Calories_Burned distribution, there are several points that could represent exceptionally high-calorie burns, possibly from unusually intense or prolonged workouts. Similarly, Session_Duration (hours) shows a few high values that deviate from the main grouping, suggesting some users may have unusually long exercise sessions. These outliers could significantly impact analysis by skewing averages or correlations, so further investigation or handling (e.g., removal or adjustment) may be warranted.



### Data Analysis
**Analysis:** Analytical methods included time series analysis, comparative analysis, and categorical comparison, focusing on visual clarity and data integrity.

### Data Visualization
**Visualization:** The project features a variety of visualization types such as 2D maps, bar charts, heat maps, and more to represent the complex data effectively.

## Findings
**Findings:** Key findings highlight the dynamic nature of the solar system, showing variations in planetary rotations, orbits, and environmental conditions that provide a deeper understanding of celestial mechanics.

## Conclusion
**Conclusion:** The Solar System Model project successfully leverages advanced data visualization techniques to illustrate the intricate relationships and physical characteristics of celestial bodies, promoting greater public engagement and educational opportunities in astronomy.
