## Project Overview
**Overview:** This analysis aims to support gym management and trainers in designing tailored fitness programs and optimizing training recommendations based on membersâ€™ unique profiles, using data-driven insights from 973 samples of gym data to create visualizations offering insights into how demographic factors impact fitness behaviors and progress.

## Questions
**Research Questions:**  
- How do demographic factors (age, gender) relate to workout intensity and duration? 
- What are typical heart rate patterns, and how do they correlate with calories burned? 
- Can we identify trends in fitness progress over time based on experience levels?

## Data Sources
**Sources:** Data was sourced from Kaggle sample dataset.

## Technologies Used
**Technologies:** This project was developed using Excel for the creation of visualizations, Jupyter Notebooks for initial data processing, and SQL for data cleaning, managing and manipulating data.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
**Collection:** Data for the planets and moons was meticulously gathered from authoritative sources, ensuring accuracy and relevancy for the project's scope.

### Data Cleaning
**Cleaning:** The data underwent rigorous cleaning processes, including unit conversions, alignment corrections, and formatting to ensure compatibility with visualization tools.

### Data Analysis
**Analysis:** Analytical methods included time series analysis, comparative analysis, and categorical comparison, focusing on visual clarity and data integrity.

### Data Visualization
**Visualization:** The project features a variety of visualization types such as 2D maps, bar charts, heat maps, and more to represent the complex data effectively.

## Findings
**Findings:** Key findings highlight the dynamic nature of the solar system, showing variations in planetary rotations, orbits, and environmental conditions that provide a deeper understanding of celestial mechanics.

## Conclusion
**Conclusion:** The Solar System Model project successfully leverages advanced data visualization techniques to illustrate the intricate relationships and physical characteristics of celestial bodies, promoting greater public engagement and educational opportunities in astronomy.
